Step 1: Make sure you have data in HDFS. Let's use the file you already created. We'll check if it's still there.
->hadoop fs -ls test/

Step 2: Start the Pig Grunt Shell In your main terminal, type pig and press Enter.
->pig
Your prompt will change to grunt>.
Step 3: Run the Pig commands Type these commands one by one at the grunt> prompt:
1.	Load the data:
->lines = LOAD 'test/localfile.txt' AS (line:chararray);
2.	Split into words:
->words = FOREACH lines GENERATE FLATTEN(TOKENIZE(line)) AS word;
3.	Group the words:
->grouped = GROUP words BY word;
4.	Count the words:
->counts = FOREACH grouped GENERATE group AS word, COUNT(words) AS count;
5.	Print the results:
->DUMP counts;
Output: You should see the result of the word count:
(Hello,1)
(Hadoop,1)

To exit Pig, type:
->quit
